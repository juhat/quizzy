== Overview

Quizzy is a quiz game. 
It helps you to became a master in a topic. 
As you solve quizzes you will be asked to write new ones. 
So it is a growing knowledge base.

=== The science behind
If you are able to correctly answer to a question in 4 following days then you learned it for forever.
You successfully saved it into your short-middle-long term memory.
Congrat!

== Getting started

- clone
- rake db:create
- rake db:migrate
- rake db:seed
- foreman start

== Workflow
- fork the project and create a branch for the new feature
- write tested code, tests first
- use factories: https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl/blob/master/GETTING_STARTED.md
- use the Shoulda doc: https://github.com/thoughtbot/shoulda-matchers
- send pull request (Travis will run the tests)

== Architechture
- Rails 4, Bootstrap 3, Postgresql
- LiveReload configured so any changes on assets loads automatically
- Foreman runs Guard so your tests runs automatically
